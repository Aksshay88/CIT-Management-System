## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the CIT Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aksshay88/CIT-Management-System.git
   cd CIT-Management-System
   ```
## Compilation

To install Apache NetBeans and run a University Management System (UMS) project, you can follow these general steps:

# Step 1: Download Apache NetBeans
Visit the official Apache NetBeans website: https://netbeans.apache.org/

Click on the "Download" button to access the download page.

On the download page, select the version of Apache NetBeans that fits your needs. Choose the package that includes Java EE if your UMS project is a web application. Alternatively, you can choose the "All" package, which includes support for Java SE, JavaFX, and HTML/JavaScript.

Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

# Step 2: Install Apache NetBeans
Follow the installation instructions provided on the NetBeans website for your specific operating system.

# Step 3: Open University Management System Project
Open Apache NetBeans after the installation is complete.

If you have an existing UMS project, go to "File" -> "Open Project" and navigate to the location of your UMS project. Select the project folder and click "Open Project."

If you don't have a UMS project yet, create a new project by going to "File" -> "New Project." Choose the appropriate project type based on your UMS (e.g., Java Application, Java Web Application).

Follow the wizard to set up your project. Import or create your Java files, configure dependencies, and set up your project structure.

# Step 4: Build and Run
Once your project is open, right-click on the project in the "Projects" pane.

Choose "Build" to compile your project.

After a successful build, right-click on the project again and choose "Run" to execute your UMS application.

# Step 5: Debugging (Optional)
If you encounter any issues during development, you can use NetBeans' debugging features. Set breakpoints in your code, run your application in debug mode, and inspect variables to troubleshoot problems.

# Note:
Ensure that you have Java installed on your system, as NetBeans is a Java-based IDE.
Apache NetBeans provides a user-friendly interface for building, debugging, and running Java applications.
These steps are general guidelines, and the exact process may vary based on your specific UMS project structure and dependencies. Follow any additional setup or configuration steps provided in your UMS project documentation.


# Step 1: Download the JAR Files
Download the following JAR files from their respective sources:

MySQL Connector for Java (mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar):

You can download it from the official MySQL website: [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).

JCalendar with Timezone Support (jcalendar-tz-1.33-4.jar):

You can find it on GitHub: toedter/jcalendar.
Download the JAR file from the releases section.
RS2XML (rs2xml.jar):

You can find it on SourceForge: [RS2XML](https://sourceforge.net/projects/finalangelsanddemons/files/rs2xml.jar/download).
Download the JAR file from the Files section.

# Step 2: Include JAR Files in Your Project
Using Apache NetBeans:
Open Apache NetBeans:

Launch NetBeans IDE.
Create or Open a Project:

Create a new Java project or open an existing one.
Create a "lib" Folder:

Inside your project, create a folder named "lib."
Copy JAR Files to "lib" Folder:

## Copy the downloaded JAR files (mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar, jcalendar-tz-1.33-4.jar, rs2xml.jar) to the "lib" folder.

Add JARs to Build Path:

Right-click on your project in NetBeans.
Navigate to "Build Path" -> "Configure Build Path."
Go to the "Libraries" tab and click "Add JARs."
Select the JAR files from the "lib" folder and click "Apply and Close."

# Using IntelliJ IDEA:

Open IntelliJ IDEA:

Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
Create or Open a Project:

Create a new Java project or open an existing one.
Create a "lib" Folder:

Inside your project, create a folder named "lib."
Copy JAR Files to "lib" Folder:

Copy the downloaded JAR files (mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar, jcalendar-tz-1.33-4.jar, rs2xml.jar) to the "lib" folder.
Add JARs to Module Dependencies:

Right-click on your project in IntelliJ IDEA.
Navigate to "Open Module Settings" or press F4.
Go to the "Libraries" tab and click the "+" icon to add a new library.
Choose "Java" and select the JAR files from the "lib" folder.
Step 3: Write Java Code
Now, you can write Java code that uses classes from these JAR files.

For example, if you are using MySQL in your project, you might want to load the MySQL driver like this:

# JAVA
```
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class MySqlConnectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Load the MySQL driver
            Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

            // Establish a connection
            String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdatabase";
            String username = "yourusername";
            String password = "yourpassword";
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);

            // Now you can use the 'connection' object for database operations
            // ...

            // Don't forget to close the connection when done
            connection.close();
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException | SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Replace "yourdatabase," "yourusername," and "yourpassword" with your actual MySQL database details.

Similarly, you can use classes from the other JAR files in your Java code based on their functionality.

Remember to handle exceptions appropriately and follow the documentation of each library for proper usage.
